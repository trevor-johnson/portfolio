- [Reddit TLDR Abstractive Summarization Model](https://github.com/trevor-johnson/portfolio/tree/main/projects/reddit_summarization) - Used a decoder transformer model in PyTorch to generate abstractive summaries of long Reddit posts. 
- [Personality Test Experiment](https://github.com/trevor-johnson/portfolio/tree/main/projects/personality_test_experiment) - Designed and carried out an experiment on 500+ individuals to test the impacts of watching a sad video on personality test scores. 
- [Predicting Flight Delays](https://github.com/trevor-johnson/portfolio/tree/main/projects/flight_delay_prediction) - Combined over 600m records of flight and weather data to predict whether or not a flight would be delayed, 15 minutes before departure time. 
- [Housing Price Prediction Challenge]() - Created an ensemble regression model to predict the sale price of a home that scored in the top 10th percentile in terms of MSE of all submissions on Kaggle.
