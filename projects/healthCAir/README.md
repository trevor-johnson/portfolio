Exposure to dangerous levels of air pollution is estimated to kill over 600,000 children every year worldwide, with fine particulate matter (PM2.5) believed to be the most deadly. But despite a good body of literature examining pollution-related health outcomes and mortality among adults and the elderly, the extent to which exposure to PM2.5 leads to chronic health conditions among children is not well-understood. Utilizing instrumental variables regression, we show that high levels of PM2.5 leads to higher rates of pediatric blood vessel disease in California. 

Because this was a group project, all code is found in my team's repository linked below.
