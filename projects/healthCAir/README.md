# HealthCAir

Exposure to dangerous levels of air pollution is estimated to kill over 600,000 children every year worldwide, with fine particulate matter (PM2.5) believed to be the most deadly. But despite a good body of literature examining pollution-related health outcomes and mortality among adults and the elderly, the extent to which exposure to PM2.5 leads to chronic health conditions among children is not well-understood. 

Using instrumental variables regression, we show that high levels of PM2.5 leads to higher rates of pediatric blood vessel disease in California. After determining this causal relationship, we used XGBoost to conduct a counterfactual analysis to show how the predicted blood vessel disease rates would differ under various PM2.5 amounts and showcase the results in Tableau.

Because this was a group project, all code is found in my team's repository linked below.
