# Short-Term Influences on Personality

Will watching a sad video immediately before taking a personality test impact the test results? The answer is yes according to our experiment. 

As part of my experiments and causal inference course at UC Berkeley, some classmates and I conducted a full end to end experiment to draw a causal inference about the impacts of a sad video on the results of a personality test. Our experiment included initial experimental design with a power analysis, an experiment carried out on 500 participants, and an analysis done on the data to conclude a causal inference. 

While this was a group project, all code in this repository is my own. The full repository that includes my teammates' code is in a private repo.
